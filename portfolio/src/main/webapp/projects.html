      <h1>Cool Projects</h1>
        <h2> Time Management</h2>
        <p> One day in September of 2018, I saw a friend of mine filling out an odd excel spreadsheet. Upon inquiring on what he was doing, I found out he had been logging his actions 
            in ten minute intervals, color coding different categories of activities. I thought, "hey, great idea!" and made my own.
            The result is that my entire life since September 28th, 2018 has been mapped out and quantified, colors representing socialization, productivity, excersize, sleep, etc.,
            Revealing patterns like my sleep schedule or breaks in the school year.

        <h2> Turkish Star Wars </h2>
        <p> One time when I was sick, my friend showed me the cult-classic movie known as "Turkish Star Wars", made infamous because of outright stealing clips from Star Wars and the soundtrack
            from indiana jones, as well as media from other copyrighted works.
            Objectively, it's one of the worst moviesever made. Subjectively, it's one of the best movies I've ever seen.
            In fact, it resonated with me so deeply that I decided I would adapt it into a video game, challenging myself to make a full game out of random 3D assets and some good old-fashioned coding.

        <h2> Agpocalypse </h2>
        <p> This last school year, I was lucky enough to have a job as a game developer with my University.
            I worked with a few other developers to create a 3D game in Unity Engine which was meant to teach kids about the strategies involved in agriculture.
            I was with the team for almost exactly a year before moving on to this internship
