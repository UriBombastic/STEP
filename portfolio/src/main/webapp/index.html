      <p>This is my portfolio.</p>
      <p><b>About Me</b></p>
      <p>Hello! I am a computer science major at the <a href = "https://www.unl.edu/">University of Nebraska - Lincoln</a>, currently interning at Google.
          I've lived in <a href = "https://www.omaha.com/">Omaha, Nebraska</a> my whole life, minus two years I spent in Kansas city and the past couple years in college at Lincoln.
          My Hobbies include creative writing, <a href = "https://store.steampowered.com/">gaming</a>,
           and <a href="https://unity.com/">game development</a>, as well as excersizing and spending time outdoors.
           I have a rather broad taste in <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0gjGrC8qfcYEtP8VNkE0ht?si=73wtJY5XSiigUAfJYnf7vw">music</a>.
          Let it be clear that I do not play the <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ">tuba.</a> (I felt that necessary to include just in case.)
      </p>
