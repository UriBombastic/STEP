      <p>This is my portfolio.</p>
      <p><b>About Me</b></p>
      <p>Hello! I am a computer science major at the University of Nebraska - Lincoln, currently interning at Google.
          I've lived in Omaha, Nebraska my whole life, minus two years I spent in Kansas city and the past couple years in college at Lincoln.
          My Hobbies include creative writing, gaming, and game development, as well as excersizing and spending time outdoors.
          I do not play the tuba. (I felt that necessary to include just in case.)
      </p>
